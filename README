README

We've decided on going with Python. 

Scraper
	Mechanize

	Working.  Requires python2


Parser
	BeautifulSoup
	lxml is our parser

	Debugging

	We can do interactive debugging by doing something like this

python -m pdb parse.py

Then you can "list" the file to find out what line numbers are

  673  history | grep python
LM-SCF-00870738:surveygerbil jpowers$  python -m pdb parse.py
> /Users/jpowers/Sites/surveygerbil/parse.py(6)<module>()
-> from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
(Pdb) l
  1  	# Needs to read in mech.out
  2  	# Then we'll parse
  3  	# http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/
  4  	# http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/files/reading-and-writing-files-in-python
  5  	
  6 

Then you can set a breakpoint, where it will stop

(Pdb) b 30
Breakpoint 1 at /Users/jpowers/Sites/surveygerbil/parse.py:30

Then "continue" until 30

(Pdb) b 30
Breakpoint 1 at /Users/jpowers/Sites/surveygerbil/parse.py:30
(Pdb) c
> /Users/jpowers/Sites/surveygerbil/parse.py(30)<module>()
-> f = open('pretty.out', 'w')
(Pdb)

From here we have it loaded in memory and we can try different stuff

(Pdb) soup.title.name
'title'
(Pdb) soup.a
<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/"><span>SurveyMonkey</span></a>
(Pdb) soup.find_all('a')
[<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/"><span>SurveyMonkey</span></a>, <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/survey-templates/" id="pbhl" target="_blank" title="Go to SurveyMonkey.com to create free online surveys">sample surveys</a>]
(Pdb)

Discussion
These were Nik's suggestions

This article recommends using BeautifulSoup (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and Windmill (http://www.getwindmill.com/). I've used the former, but not the latter.
